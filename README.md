# Pachinko

A simple game application using SpriteKit, physics, blend modes, radians and CGFloat. 
The player places obstacles in the edit mode, and gets throws for each obstacle. 
For hitting the green hole, points and throws are awarded, for a miss (hitting the red hole), points and throws are reduced.
